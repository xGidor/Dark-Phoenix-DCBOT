# The Dark Phoenix Project
An old discord bot of mine from 2018. (Out of Support, just for archiving)

I made this discord bot for a server I used to run with friends back in 2018. I still was very new to programming at this point so looking back, I don't even know what the hell is this.

However if you want to take some snippets from this (which I don't advise because this is higly out of date discord.js) go ahead and do it.

## Dependencies:
- Discord.JS 11.2.0
- ytdl-core 0.24.0

## Info
I highly doubt this would work now in newer versions of Discord.JS but it was a fun little project if I think back.

I will provide no support for this repository so if you want to upgrade this to newer versions go ahead and fork it.
